## Basic usage:

### BaeApp

A simple wrapper for run a terminal canvas instance.

### BaeRenderingTask

An utility class you need to inherit, it has a DPI(Draw Pipeline Interface) for providing various drawing methods:

**def drawStyleText(x:int, y:int, txt:str, fontColor=ColorPallette4bit.white, bgColor= ColorPallette4bit.black_bg, style:BaeFontStyle = 0, bNeedRestStyle:bool = False)**

    used for drawing text on canvas

**def drawLine2D(self, start:BaeVec2d, end:BaeVec2d, color:BaeVec3d)**

    used for drawing line on canvas

**def drawSolidCircle2D(self, center:BaeVec2d, r:float, color:BaeVec3d)**

    used for drawing circle on canvas

**def drawPixel(self,x:int,y:int,color:BaeVec3d)**

    the most basic method, you can use is to draw various patterns

**def runShader(self, shader:Callable[[int,int,dict],BaeVec3d])**

    Another version of drawPixel is conceptually equivalent to a shader (or kernel) running on a GPU. Note: It still runs on the CPU in the Python interpreter.
